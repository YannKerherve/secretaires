DN RM LO N-DON:  Printed for G. Wricnur. 1758,"",""(v)  A â€”â€”â€”â€” INTRODUCTION. TER E is nothing more commendable, and  At the fame time more useful in life, than to be able to write letters on all occasions with elegance and propriety. When you write to a friend, your letter should be a true picture of your heart, the style loose and irregular"; the thoughts them- {elves should appear naked, and not drafted in the borrowed robes of rhetoric; for a friend will be more pleased with that part of a letter which flows from the heart, than with that which is the pro- duet of the mind. 1 would not however be UN- serfhood to mean, that the passions themselves may not be drafted in wit, provided it fits easy and natural, and {CEMS rather expressive of the thoughts, than placed there for any beauty of its own. When you write merely out of compliment, it is done more to please your correspondent than - yourself ;" and therefore you should endeavor to hit his taste : but at the fame time never forget to make choice of that subject, if possible, you are the greatest after of. When the subject 15 determined, you must be careful to fix your eyes on the brightest part of it, that when you have taken all the pains in your power to adorn it, you may have the satisfaction to feel it appears pleading and graceful, A 3 In"",""(vi) | In writing to a fir anger, the first thing necessary - to be observed, is your correspondentâ€™s station in. life, and the ceremonies proper to be observed, | that every thing may be conducted accordingly. But be his condition what it will, you should be very careful to let an air of good breeding and humanity appear in every expression, which will give a pleading beauty to the whole. Â¥ When you write letters on the common con-* ferns of life, elegance is not required "; EAFE and perspicuity are the only beauties you should study. V â€˜Write freely, but not hastily ; let your words drop * from your pen, as they would from your tongue when {peaking deliberately on a subject of which you are Mahler, and to a person with whom you - are intimate. But be sure to think closely on the subject of Â° your letter before you fit down to write. Thesisâ€™ caution which may appear unnecessary ; - but I will venture to fay, that hundreds appear ridiculous on paper throwâ€™ hurry and want of thought, for one that is really for for want of understand- ING. â€œBefore you begin any {sentence, ponder the whole: in your mind, and make UFE of the first words that. Offer themselves to express the meaning ; for they;. Are the most natural, and will, in general, left an-. Fewer your purpose. Forced expressions will {poil}. â€˜The easy flow of your Dion, and render the whole Â§ FIFF and awkward. But above all things learn to! Write correct, and never fail to give your letter a. careful perusal before you fend it. Nor ever be ashamed to amend anything you find amiss, even when you have no time to transcribe your letter;" | for a blot in the writing is by no means for bad: as a blunder in the fence, | | With |"","". (vii)  . With regard to letters of business, they should """"be plain, concise, and to the purpose, but at .the fame time full and sufficient to -express your â€˜meaning "; for it is a most ridiculous piece of â€˜vanity to write in for concise a manner as to render your letter doubtful, and perhaps united- }eligible. In short, your language, in all letters of ; business, should be for natural, that the thoughts ;"may feet to have been conceived in the very words they are expressed in, and your sentiments i to have {sprung up naturally like the fillies of the- I field, whole natural beauty excels all the dress of s human art.   |  A y  i |  Lo  | A 4 A Come"",""(vii) A Compendious OO GG R AMMAR OF THE. | ENGLISH TONGUE. R AMMAR Isth art of [peaking or writing a language correctly"; and is divided into four parts, Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody. | Orthography is the art of combining letters intoâ€™ fables, and syllables into words. Words confit of one or more letters or syllables, As 1, awe, thou, Joseph, Abraham, Sc. The English alphabet confits of twenty-fix letters ;" of which five are vowels, and twenty-one: consonants. | y A vowel is a letter that makes a full and per left found of itself, without the assistance of any other letter, and are the five following, a, e. iv 0, \u. If Am consonant is a letter that cannot be founded without the help of a vowel either before or after! It. â€˜The twenty-one consonants are as follows: b, c, d, f, g, b, j, k, ,, my n, p, q, 1,5, TV, WW XS Yo He â€” eyed"",""EEE â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Xx)  A syllable is the found of one or more letters ex-p reffed in one breath. OC  If a word has but one syllable, it is called a MO- syllable "; if two, a disyllable ; if three, a trophy- table ; and if of more, a polysyllable.  Â¥ is often used instead of 7; but having then the fame found, there is no necessity of considering it as a dating vowel. But when y comes before a vowel it is a consonant, as in ye, yes.  In order to fell a word rightly, ITIS necessary to divide it into distinct syllables. Thus, if you should hear the word philosopher pronounced, and define to {Pell it properly, divide it thus, PBI-lo-fo-pher ; but in order to this, the three following rules will be necessary.  1. If a consonant comes betwixt two vowels, it must be joined to the latter, as pa-per, a-bide, naked, EC. except before the letter x, which is always joined to the vowel that precedes: it, as in ox-en, excess exercise.  2. When two consonants of the fame kind come together in the middle of a word, and both are fully pronounced in distinct founds, they must be divided ;" that is, one of them must be put to the former, and the other to the latter {syllable, as in borrow, common, little.  3. When two vowels come together in the middle of a word, and both are fully pronounced in DIF- Tibet founds, they must be divided into fighting {YL- labels, as create, ruin, No-ab.  Great letters are never to be used in the middle or end of words, nor are they to be used at the beginning of words, except in the following cafÃ©s.  1. At the beginning of any writing,  z. After a period or full flop, when a new fen- hence begins,  A 3 3. A"",""â€” 7 (=x) 3. Anthe beginning of every verse in poetry, or in the Bible.  4. At the beginning of proper names of all kinds, as of men, women, cities, rivers, {.  5. At the beginning of any remarkable word,â€™ as God, King, Sir, he.  6. The pronoun 7 must be always a capital or great letter,  Of marks used in writing.  There are several characters and marks used in writing, for rendering the fence of the package- more Ea{y to be conceived.  1. A hyphen, marked thus (-). It is placed at the end of a line, when there is no room for all the word,â€ but one or more syllables remain to be written at the beginning of the next line. It is also used in the compounding, or joining two words into one, as House-kecper, market-bought, EC.  2. An apostrophe, marked thus ('), and is used to denote some letter or letters to be omitted, in order to render the pronunciation quicker, as EV'Ry for every, warpâ€™d for warped, cursâ€™d for curved, he.  3. An afterlife, marked thus (*), and is used to dire to some note or remark in the margin, or bottom of the page.  4. An index or hand, marked thus (iz5=). The fat-finger pointing signifies that package to be very remarkable against which it is placed.  5. An oblique or dagger, marked thus (+), is used for the fame intention as the afterlife.  .6. A region or division, marked thus (Â§), is used in subdividing a chapter into lefter Paris or portions.  | 7. A"",""â€™ (XY, 6. A quotation, or double comma inverted, marked thus (Â¢Â¢). It is placed at the beginning of Ya line, to denote that the package is transcribed from some author in his own words. Of flops used in writing. 1. A comma, marked thus (, ), is the shortest pause used, and distinguishes the conjure me- â€˜bars of a sentence "; as, Hearken unto we, my people, and give ear unto me, O my nation. v. 2. A {semicolon, marked thus (;), 1s something : longer than a comma, and ought to be placed in â€˜ the subdivision of a sentence : As the shadow moves, and ave do not perceive it 5 or as the tree grows, and WWE do not apprehend it; for man, FC. It is allo Â» used in distinguishing nouns of a contrary signify- cation 3 as things public 3 things private 5 things fa- { cred or profane. â€˜TG. A colon, marked thus (:), is used when the { fence is perfect, but the sentence not ended ; as, Â§ Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness;, he ye that deck the Lord: look unto the rock Â«whence ye â€œare bean, and to the bole of the pit whence ye are ; digged. 4 4. A period, marked thus (.), is the greatest } pause, and is placed at the end of a sentence, : when the fence is complete. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament health bis bandy- 3 work, w 5. A point of interrogation, marked thus (i), Wis used when a question is asked ;" as, hath the rain """"| a father? Or who bath begotten the drops of the dew ? I 6. A point of admiration, exclamation, or won- 4 der, marked thus (1), is a note of direction for 1 raising the tone of the voice, the words denoting 4 for: vehement Paphian";" as, O the folly of men!  A G6 7. A"",""(xii) : 7. A parenthesis serves for the distinction of such an additional part of a sentence, as is not: necessary to PerceÂ¢t the fence of it, and is gene. Rally expressed by including such words between/ two curved or crooked lines, marked thus ()"; as, Your kindness to me (which I account a very great hap- MINEFI) animates my spirits, EC. Of Etymology. Etymology is that part of grammar which teaches the deduction of one word from another, and the â€˜various modifications by which the fame word is diversified. |  Words are divided into two kinds, primitive. And derivative. \  A primitive word is that which comes from noâ€™ other word in our language, as ff, babe, (5c. A derivative word is that which comes from some other word in our language; as, a fiber, And fifty, from fib ; a babbler, cabling, from babe,  1 Of the Article.  The English have two articles, aÂ» or a and he. | :  An or a has an indefinite signification, and I'm- | plies one ; as, This is a good book, that is, one among the books that arc good, An army might enter with- out refinance, that's, any army might enter, EC.  In the fences where we UFE a or ax in the fine. Car, we {peak in the plural without any article at all ;" as, There are good books.  When the substantive to which the article 1s pre-fixed begins with a vowel or the silent b, we UFE  an,"",""(xii) an but when it begins with a consonant, 2"; as, a ewe-lamb, a herd a cow, a goat, JC,  The has definite and an indefinite signification the former refrains the fence of the word it is placed before, to that particular object ; the latter leaves the word undetermined, with regard to any particular. Thus, for instance, The book is good), that is, #bis particular book. Here the has a definite fence : but in the following instance the fence is indefinite, Â¢Â¢ He gives fodder for the cattle, and Â«Â¢ herb for the UFE of men.â€  Many words are used without an article, particularly proper and abstract names ; as John, JE- ruffled, London, virtue, nice, beauty, ugliness, love, hatred, anger, Cc.  Of Nouns.  A noun is the name of a thing; and is either {substantive or adjective. A noun substantive is the thing itself, as, a man, a bore, bog, 5c. A noun adjective is that which expresses the quality or properties of the thing, as, a rich man, a /are house, a /mall field ;" where rich, large, and small, are ad- derives, because they indicate the properties of the substantives wan, house, and field.  Of Numbers,  Number is the distinction of one from many, """"There are two numbers, the singular and the PLU. Ran. The singular number is used when we peak of one single thing ";" as, a horse, a cow, a dog, a man, a tree. â€˜The plural number is used when we {peak of more things than on, as Borges, cows, men, dogs, trees, {Fe Note, When the singular number ends in CB, FB, or x, the plural is formed  â€˜ by"",""{ xiv) by adding ES"; as brush, bubbles 5 avidness, Hartnell ESS box, boxes : but if the singular number ends in FM, he, CE, Or in GE pronounced foot, then the 5, added to form the plural number, cannot be heard in the found, except it make an entire ghyllÂ»BLC; as bore, (suggestion limit reached) ; (suggestion limit reached), (suggestion limit reached); face, (suggestion limit reached);" age, (suggestion limit reached). â€˜The plural of words ending in """"and FM is formed by changing the termination to was"; as calf, calves; knife, knives; folk, [elves thief, thieves 3; Adolf; wolves. There are however many exceptions to this rule; as roof, rooms; grief, griefs 3; dwarf, dwarfs; and allo ruff, m:f, cuff, make Â»uf5, BC.; but fluff, thoâ€™ it ends with /, makes flaws in the plural. Besides there, there are many irregular words in our language, while plural is formed in a very different manner; as chick chicken; die, dice; mouse, mice ; guide, geese 3 penny, pence ; foot, feet, and several others. It must also be observed, that some words are the {fame in both numbers, as (Beep, bone, fern, EC. and {one want the singular number, as gaffes, novels, bellows, breeches, lungs, fallers, snuffers, tongs, wages: while, on the other hand, many words want the plural, as the names of men, women, cities, countries, mountains, rivers, {&Â¢.  and also the names of virtues, vices, metals, JC. Of the CafÃ©s,  The Latin, Greek, and other languages, have several cafÃ©s ; but the English only one, namely, the genitive, which ends in the singular and plural in s or ES;" as Pope's Messiah, Dryden's Virgil, Advisorâ€™s Cato, the State's power, the King of Prussiaâ€™s army, and the like,  | of"",""(xv) Of Gender.  The English language is free from gender, by which means it is rendered much more easy than it would be where it like the Latin, Â£&Â¢. Encamp~ - beard with cafÃ©s and genders, that is, with different terminations in the nouns, to express their different significations.  Gender signifies the distinction of fees, or the difference between male and female. We have four different methods of distinguishing the two genders, or the male and female few.  1. By different words"; as, buck, doe ;, bull, cow; cock, Ben 3 hare, mare; man, woman ; king, queen ; lord, lady 5 lads, laws, BC.  2. When one word signifies equally both fees, we add another word to it, to the which of the two is intended ; as, a male child, a female child ; a be goat, a FHE goat.  3. By adding another substantive to the word ; as, a man servant, a maid servant; a cock sparrow, a Ben {narrow.  4. By a different termination in the {substantive, in conformity to the Latin ; as, abbot, abbess 5 bar, bares 3 actor, all refs 35 hunters, bunt refs ; ambassador, ambassadress 5 barons, baroness ; governor, governess ; Few, Leaves ; lion, lioness ; patron, patron/s 3 count, (suggestion limit reached) 5 prior, (suggestion limit reached) ; (suggestion limit reached), (suggestion limit reached) ;" poet, (suggestion limit reached) 5 (suggestion limit reached), (suggestion limit reached).  But the common and ordinary words used to express the difference of few, arc AE and foe.  Of the comparison of Adjectives. In order to compare adjectives, that is, to make the proper comparison between things, we gene-rally alter the termination. There arc three de- | green"",""(xvi) if green of comparison, the positive, the comparative, :â€™ and the superlative, as FOF?, foxier, often. The";" positive degree is the adjective, and used to denote ! The thing to be simply such, as for/7 wool, a fair | woman, a large free. .  The comparative degree is used to denote a thing to be more {such than another thing, as foster wooly, a fairer woman, a larger tree.  """"The superlative degree is used to denote the thing to be most such, as the forest avcal, the fairest AO- man, the large ff tree. . %  In the above examples it may be observed, that. The positive degree is nothing merer than the ad-~ festive itself "; that the comparative is formed by adding her to the positive; and the superlative, by: adding Â¢7 to the positive.   But there is also another manner of comparing adjectives, namely, by the words more and mph; as beautiful, more beautiful, MOF beautiful. But adjectives are also irregular with regard to their DE-| green of comparison; as, good, better, left 5 bad, are, worst ; little, left or deffer, left much, more, gaff. |  Of Pronouns. |  A pronoun is a part of speech, which is used in. field of a noun substantive ; and are the following! I, thou, be, with their plurals' ave, ye, they;" it, ABO, which, Arhat, av hither, whosoever, whatsoever, my,  mine, our, ours, thy, thine, your, yours, bis, BER, bars, their, theirs, this, that, other, another, the fame. | Of the Verb, A verb is a word that implies being, doing, of Suffering, 1. Being"",""(xvii)  1. Being denotes that the thing spoken of is in some posture or situation, as to land, to fit, to hang, to lie, BC.  2. Doing signifies all manner of action, as #0 av rite, to walk, to ride, to play, BC.  3. Suffering implies the impressions that persons or things receive, as for be beat, to be cheated, to life, BC. OE  Those verbs that signify being only, are called essential verbs "; those that signify doing, verbs active ; and those that imply offering, verbs affiche.  A verb hath two forms of voices, the active and the alive. The active voice expresses what is done by the agent before it, as I love, Irate. The alive voice, which is made by the auxiliary verb am, expresses what is done to or suffered by the person or agent going before it, as I am burned, 1 am hated.  Grammarians confider three tenses or times, the present, the part, and the future; because every action must be now doing, already done, or to be done hereafter. But English verbs have but two tenses or times distinguished by their terminations, namely, the present, and the Peter or part. The present tense is the verb itself, as Morris; and the preterite, or part time, is commonly formed by adding ed or & to it, as mourn, mourned ; Â«walk, talked.  But the English tongue has a great many irregular verbs, which arc conjugated in a very different manner 3 as bear, bore, borne ; begin, began, begun 3 bids, bad, bidden ; do, did, done ; drive, drove, driven 5 give, game, given ; know, Anew, known 3 rife, role, risen ; fee, fast, been ;" write, wrote, written,  Verbs are also divided into active and neuter.  | A verb alive is that which can have after ITA â€” noun"","": (xviii } noun implying the subject of the action which the verb is used to denote, as to receive a bribe, to fire a cannon, to take a ca file, and the like.  A verb neuter is 2 word implying the state or being, and sometimes the action of a Paton or thing "; but can have MO noun after it; as, the bore walks, the chimney fin oaks, the dog barks, BC.  OF the Adverb.  An adverb 1s a word joined to a verb, adjective, participle, or to another adverb, to express some quality, manner or circumstance belonging to it; as, the horse walks eye//; the man is now good, thoâ€™ lately picked ; the boy is idle by indulging.  Of the Participle.  A participle is a word, or part of speech, derived from a verb, and implies being, doing, or suffering ; as, I was fitting ; 1 am reading the book ; I was abided in the streets.  Participles are divided into active and alive : the former ends in ING, as Owing, hating, running, walking, riding;" and the latter ends in ed, as burned, killed, lowed, and the like,  Of the Conjunction, |  A conjunction is a part of {speech that joins words and sentences together, and chews the DE- penance they have on each other,  Conjunctions are either,  x. Copulative, as and, also, both, neither nor.  2. Disjunctive, as either, or.  3. Conceive, as though, although, albeit."",""{ xix)  a. Advertise, as but, yet, notwithstanding, nÃ©e  Worthless.  5. Casual, as for, that, because.  Of the Interjection.  An interjection is a word or part of {speech which denotes some hidden motion or passion of the foul "; and therefore they are of different kinds, as of joy, grief, wonder, praise, aversion, exclaiming, surprise, imprecation, laughter, calling, silencing, derision, attention ; as, bey! Brave! Alas! O flange! Well done! OB! Ha! Silence! Bark! And the like.  Of SYNTAX.  Syntax is the right placing or joining of words together in penitences.   A {sentence is any thought of the mind expressed by two or more words, and is either simple or compound. A simple sentence is that which has but one verb finite in it, as God 1s JU}. A compound sentence, is when two sentences are joined together by some conjunction, as Riches profit not in the day of wrath; but righteousness delivered From death.  The verb agrees with the substantive in number and person: The avatar runner ; the horses run Swiftly. In the first instance, the substantive avatar is finger, therefore the verb runner is singular also; but in the second, the {substantive Borges is plural, and thence the verb run plural likewise.  When the substantive is collective, that is, comprehends many particulars, the verb may be either in the singular or plural number;" as, The fleet is  EE EEE A â€”â€”â€” TTT"",""! (xx) come to an anchor, or The fleet are come to an anchor "; is being the singular number, and are the plural.  When two {substantives, one of which is in the | genitive cafÃ©, come together, that in the genitive Â° cafÃ© must be put first; as, the fun's beat; the RI- ~ we's brink 3 the mowers faith.  Of Prosob by. Prosody teaches the true pronunciation of words, | their accents, and the quantities of {syllables. But as there are for many exceptions to every rule that | can be given for pronouncing English words, we | fall omit them here, and refer the reader to some | dictionary of the English tongue where the words | are accented, which they are now in most; for by carefully observing to pronounce them according to the accents placed over them, that difficult part of the English language, a proper pronunciation, may be obtained ;" which is impossible to be done by bare rules only. | The"",""Co skoetoskoskakoaks shoskaskeesekonkeoksikeckecks AIE EEE Sal a TD CD her EE SRE The Familiar  LETTER-WRITER.

This is not living, but a constant endeavor to cheat themselves out of the little time they have to live: for they generally inherit a bad constitution, make it wore by their absurd way of life, and deliver a still weaker and weaker thread down to their children, I donâ€™t know any on thing more ridiculous than the feeing their wrinkled fallow faces all FET out with diamonds. Poor mistaken gentlewomen! They should ended- vour to avoid peoples eyes as much as possible, and not to attract them ; for they are really a quite deplorable fight, and their very faces are a stand- ING lesson against the flange lives that they lead.

Dear William,  TH E RE sone very good rule I {hall give you  About what you AFK, and Thais, to take care never to make bad debts. I allure you, this has been the great secret of my conduct, and I owe what success I have had in the world more to this than to anything else whatever. Nobody in trade ever refused for many customers as I have done "; but, William, one bad debt runs away with the profit of many good ones: for this reason I have left experience than you think in there matters, but 1 {hall give you my advice as well as I can,  I Ara not of opinion you should array the gentle-man by any means. It 1s a very good method where people have money and will not pay ; but there are two reasons against it in such a cafÃ© as you peak of: it is cruel, and it answers no purpose. Instead of getting the money now, it will prevent his ever being able to pay you at all;" for a min  that"",""The Familiar LETTER-WRITER. 87 that has nothing but his business, will never make much of .that in the rules of a prison. Never lend money to your customers for the future "; for ITIS a common maxim, and it is too true, that those who borrow money seldom pay it.  I would have you depend in this matter upon frequent asking for your money ; and tell the gentleman that you are distressed in your own cir- substances. I have known some people, who, when they were uneasy about large debt, have in- fighter upon the debtorâ€™s finding some persons be security that he should pay them: this is getting bail without going to law ; but I believe it is very seldom that they are able to obtain this. A man would sooner bid them do their worst, and give in bail to an anion, because he can then pretend some dispute about the demand, and it is an excuse fora king, and the law will give-him as much time as the creditor is generally inclined to allow ; for if you arrest the gentleman to-morrow, you will not be able to recover your money this twelvemonth : nay, most likely you would never get it at all; for the law allows all that delay ; and then the debtor, if he cannot pay, is only to live in St. Georgeâ€™s- Fields, or the Borough, a place that thousands of people chute.â€™  Take care, William, how you have any deal kings, for the future, with people that ARÂ¢ at all dubious : If you get them into your books, never let them get far; and, whatever you do, never lend money to those who are in your debt already. There are the left rules 1 can give you for your future conduct : as for the present, it 3s my opinion, the left way is to dun continually.

It is ever for little at a time : he will find that he is obliged to you not to distress him farther"; and as you never design to do it, never threaten : this is the greatest of all folly in a creditor : if he designs to proceed to law, he never should tell the person of it beforehand, for it is bidding him keep out of the way ; and if he does not intend to do it, it is only making him hate him as well as fear him, and never answers any purpose. By civil behavior, and constant application, you will get in your money by degrees, as fact as he can pay it, and, in the meanwhile, you will have him for a customer with ready money.  I have written you a long letter ; but as you asked my advice, I was willing to give you my reasons for it: besides, I think you have a right to know every thing that I do, relating to trade ; and, if you had not, I have a respect for you that would make me comply with any such request, or readily do anything to serve you.

As they excel in the Charms of their Persons. If ITIS too general a Complaint of the fair Ladies, that when their Husbands or Lovers are removed, by Business or the Duties of their Stations, from the immediate Influence of their Attractions, they frequently grow cool, or become inconstant and false "; Letters are an Expedient to charm at a Distance, and to secure that Empire over the Mind, in Absence, (by the Conveyance of their fond Wishes, their Languishments, and the Allurements of their Understanding, to the remotest (suggestion limit reached) ; by wafting their Sighs from Indus 20 the Pole) (suggestion limit reached) their (suggestion limit reached) Beauties had acquired .over (suggestion limit reached) Heart when (suggestion limit reached), and to (suggestion limit reached) the (suggestion limit reached) of their Concern from Levity or (suggestion limit reached). . In the Joys of Friendship, but particularly in the Affairs of Love, how wretched must that Woman, be, who cannot give a becoming Dress to her Esteem .or KER Fondness by Letter! How mortifying to call in the Aid of a third Person, to instruct, perhaps, not only a Stranger, but a treacherous Underminer- and Supplanter, with her dearest, choicest Secrets ; or, on'the other hand, by her unmeaning, ill-spent, unsentimental Scrawl, to hazard the Loss of that Esteem or Tender- news the would with should last forever. In short, we may place the Disadvantages the Want of this Know-ledge lays them under, and the manifest Benefits arising from a Skill in this Matter, in as many Lights as we please ; it is only employing oneâ€™s {elf in the idle â€œTalk of proving a self-evident Proposition, which requires it no more than to prove that two and two make four, which no Man in his Senses will deny: If hall therefore, without more words, endeavor to lay down some general Rules for acquiring an easy Stile and elegant Manner of writing letters. . The first and most evident Step the Young Lady, or others, should take, should be to attend to .the â€˜inane excellent Letters, on every Subbed, presented to them in the following Pages, which-are for elected as to come LomÃ© to every Oce3fishidhige can, almost, arise, NER Si.

Endeavor first to think clearly, to revolve the Mat- -TER they are about to write upon in their Minds, and then to clothe their Sentiments in such Language as the Thoughts immediately dictate, observing the Quality - of the Person wrote to, as well as their own ;" for it would be absurd to address a Lover with those Exp ref- - fins that should be used to a Father, or to write as familiarly to a Lady of Quality, as to your Waiting- â€œWoman, ~ â€˜When the Letter is finished, a careful (suggestion limit reached) of it will + be (suggestion limit reached), and if it is thought expedient to (suggestion limit reached) out """"7 Ba many"",""[4]  _Any Expressions and substitute others, better liked, in their Room, 1t would be better to transcribe the Whole fairly over again, than to expose a Number of Blots and Interiineations to your Correspondent.

Indeed, that may easily be; for I have never yet heard my Matter fay a single Word to any one of us, but what was kind and encouraging.

What they call a Life of Pleasure among the Great, must be a very laborious Life : They {pend the greatest Part of the Night in Balls and AF- families, and fling away the greatest Part of their Days in Sleep: Their Life 1s too much opposeâ€™d to Nature to be capable of Happiness: This all a Hurry of Visits, twenty or thirty perhaps in a Day, to Per- phons of whom there are not above two or three that they have any real Friendship or Esteem for {supposing them to be capable of either); a perpetual seeking after what they call Diversions ; an Insipidity, and Want of (suggestion limit reached), when they are engaged in them ;" and a certain (suggestion limit reached).

They should endeavor to avoid Peopleâ€™s Eyes as much as possible, and not to attract them; for they are _ really a quite deplorable Sight, and their very Faces * are a standing Lesson against Che range Lives they  Lead.  People in a lower Life, this true, do not a Flo Rida- closely as those in a higher; but even among them too thereâ€™s a vast Difference between the People -that live well, and the People that live ill ; the former are more healthy, in better spirits, fitter for Business, and more attentive to it; the latter are more negligent, more real, more contemptible, God more, defeated.  In Truth, either in high or in low Life; Virtue is only another Name for Happiness, and Debauchery is the High-Road to Misery; and this, to me, appears just as true and evident, as that Moderation is always good for us, and Excess always hurtful... ;  But 1s it not a charming Thing to; have Youth and Beauty, â€”to be followâ€™d and admired, ~ to have Presents offerâ€™d from all sides to one, â€”to be invited to all Di< versions, and to be distinguished by the Men from all the left of the Company ?â€”â€”Yes, my dear Child.

Let the chief Part of your Finery, then, be Mo: deity ; it has great Advantages; it gets off Beauty, and serves as a Veil to Ugliness: Modesty is the Supplement of Beauty. The great Misfortune of Ugliness is, that it mothers and buries the Merit of Women.

You are not to neglect the Accomplishments and Ornaments proper to make you agreeable, for Women are designed to please;" but you should rather think of acquiring a solid Merit, than of employing yourself in trifling Things.

Women, therefore, must have an amiable Merit, and join the Graces to the Virtues. I do not confine the Merit of Women merely to Modesty; I give ITA much larger Extent. A valuable Woman exerts the manly Virtues of Friendship, Probity and Honor, in the punctual Discharge of all her Obligations: An 2miable Woman fold not only have the exterior Graces, but all-the Graces of the Heart, and fine Sentiments of the Mind.

Letters serve to make Syllables, and Syllables Words, BC. One {ingle or one double Vowel only; or any one of the single or double Vowels joined to any one of the single or double Consonants will make a Syllable, No Number of Consonants can make a Syllable without a Vowel; as Â§ #Â»Â» go 5 can make no Syllable of them-f elves, but if I put in (Â¢) betwixt (Â») and (x) thus, Strength, 1t makes a Syllable and a proper Word; and therefore 2s many Vowels, single, or double, as AIE found in a Word, of for many Syllables does that Word confit, which are never above even or eight, and few Words have for many ; as good, one; feebly, two; (suggestion limit reached)- her, three; (suggestion limit reached), tour; (suggestion limit reached), five ; (suggestion limit reached) ti on, fix ; Tran (suggestion limit reached), (suggestion limit reached) ; (suggestion limit reached)=(suggestion limit reached), eight;"  A Monosyllable, 1s a Word of owe Syllable:  A Disyllable, ISA Word of RAE Syllables,  A â€˜Trisyllable, is a Word of Bree Syllables.  A Polysyllable, is a Word of many Syllables.  There are five general Rules for the true Division of Syllables,  Rule 1. When a single Consonant comes between two vow._ls, it goes with the last Vowel in dividing the Syllables: as a-date, cabal, decay, Go.Ry, E-went, Women, above, among, divide, BC.  By Rule 2,"",""4. A Plain and Compendious  Run: 2. When two Consonants meet in the Middle of a Word, between two vowels which are not proper to begin a Word, they are parted in dividing the Syllables: as Heading, Ac term, Verging Mutton, Butter, 9rum- pit, Bar-gain, BC.  Rule 3. When two or three Consonants meet between two vowels that are proper to begin a Word, then they go with the last Syllable in the Division: as deprive, Eve-ftlen-denty, Brother, reprieve, d-bridge, Tablet, restrict, BC.  Run: 4. When three or four Confonans meet between two vowels which are not proper to begin a Word. The first Consonant is always kept with the first Syllable in the Division: as pub-/#rad?, aggravate, AF- J, Congruity, con -full, inferior, FCC,  Rule 5. When two vowels of different Sounds meet in the Middle of Words, they are parted in the Dividing Syllables, as Liar, real, Riot, Trial Li-on, Being, vow-Â¢/, BC.  Compound â€˜Words are always {pelt as their dimples thus, Craftsmen, Goldsmith, Gazing-flock, Shipwrecks transact, disunite, unequal,-BC.  Derivative Words are always {pelt as their Primitive, thus, tempt, tempt-ed"; Second, Secondary; covet, comet- us 3 form, form-cÂ¢d, &Â¢C,  But when the Primitive ends with a Vowel, and the Syllable which is added begins also with a Vowel, then the first Vowel is always drop, and the Sound of the preceding Consonant is softened by the tube- quest Vowel, as ape, A-fib 5 Fame, famous ; Lowe Look~CD; give, giver; move, moving; hate, hating 5 dance, dancing 3 1rvifla, (suggestion limit reached) ; bubble, bubbling, (suggestion limit reached).

Time, begins with a Consonant, then the Vowel in the Primitive is always retained, according to the Rule of derivative Words; as love, lovely; like, Likeness, fine, finely 5 Time, time LY, EC.  And when the primitive Word ends with (YP) it is. changed unto (7) in the Derivative; as Dry, dutiful ; crafty, Craftiness ; angry, Angriness; Envy, envious Fe. But (YP) is retrained before the Vowel (7), as 1eflify, terrifying s multiply, multiplying 5 Envy, envying; deny, denying ; apply, applying, JC.  And when a Word of one or more Syllables ends with a single Consonant, and no Diphthong goes before it, and the Accent lies on the last Syllable, then that Congo- nant is always doubled in the Derivative; as man, manned ; pen, penned ; fan, fanned; fir, flirted; tin, in- Ned; fin, finned; flop, fop-ping; deep, drop-ping 5 tum, Tunney 5c.  + OF primitive and derivative Words,  I.

Though the (4d) In Pledge, BC. Is superfluous, and seems to have been put in to shorten the Sound.  Rule 6. There Words markâ€™d with (GUE) at the End, as Argue, Pique, antique, oblique, oblique, Re- gigue, is the French Way of Writing, who UFE (go) because they have not (4)"; but the Genius of our Language requires them to be marked with (ct) if Mo- syllables, as Back, Pick, and with (Â¢) only, if more than one Syllable, as antic, Republic, public, &-c. K is a very useless and superfluous Letter after (CJ, and should not be written at the End of Words exceeding one Syllable, (c) being always hard when it ends either a Syllable or Word; as Arithmetic, Logic, Me- thematics, Frederic, Physic, botanic, prophetic, public, Music, BC.  Rule 7. The Letter Â¢/) is always doubled at the End of Monosyllables, as Bull, Bell, Bill, Bill, Bull, [fell tell, Cavell, BC.

But after any other Consonant it is marked from, except Contention, Uneven- tion, Attention, Dissention, and Intention, Condescension. But when to write ZI and f# is one of the difficult eft Talks to lay down a Rule for. Nothing but diligent Observation of the above Rule and Practice can remove it: Form oft Words ending in tonÂ» and from, are Latin Verbals, and are formed of the first Supine, which, if it ends in rum, then we write #/, if in Jim, then Â£.  Observe farther, that the long and short Sounds of the Vowels are marked with their simple Characters, a, Â¢4 i, 0, 2, in all the additional Beginnings and Endings ; but that there single Vowels never end Words with their {simple nor naked Character, a, o Z, Of U.

Now as for the Consonants, their Sounds may be field to be invariable in all words, except (Â¢) and (GJ which arc treated of already. All to be observed is, that when the Stress of the Pronunciation lies on the Consonants 4, CS Dy fogy by ms NY by 7, 55 thank you, 2, that they are always to be doubled "; as Scabbard, where the Stress lies upon the 6): So likewise commit, where the Stress of the Voice lies upon (72). But another Way to know when there Consonants should be doubled, is to observe if the Vowel be short before 1t, and if for, then it mulls be doubled ; as in Scabbard, where the (OO) before (4) is short; and in commit, where (o) is short before (72): For if 1 hear the Sound of the Vowel to belong, the. 1 Putin butane Congo- nant. And this is a general Rule, that a Vowel before two Consonants is short.  And now [ think by the above Rules, any Difficulty in spelling the Generally of Voids that has occurred RO me, is removed ;" for the Scholar being truly Vaught the various Sounds of Vowels and Consonants, both single and double, nothing being a greater help to true Spelling, will not fail by Pronunciation of any Number of Letters to the LAR, to give their proper Characters in Writing.

(a) is written before a Word beginning with a Consonant; but when the Substantive begins with a Vowel, or (4); if the (4) be not founded, then we write (AR) instead of (a); as, an AFS, an Eye, an Hour, a Hoff, an Heir ; but a Hare, a Hand, BC. Because the (4) is founded. 4 is an Article of Number, and signifies as much as on, and is. put for it; as, '@ Man; i. e, one Man; an Hour 3 1. e. one Hour: Or (aux) denotes or {signifies the applying a general Word to some one particular person or Thing, in a large Sense, not telling what Particular Person or Thing you mean; as Idleness is a Shame 5.

COMPARISON is the altering the Significant- (ton of a Word into more or left Degrees, where-by we feet hut one Thing is bright another brighter, and a third is Highest, And only Adjectives are compared ;" they being only capable of having their Significations increased or diminished. There are three Degrees of Comparison 3 the Positive, the Comparative, and the Superlative T'he Positive Degree is the Adjective it- felt simply without any Likeness or Comparison, as /if7, bard, great. """"The Comparative heightens or leaflets the Positive in Signification. I'he Superlative heightens or leaflets the Quality to a very high or very low Degree. Note, The Positive, properly f{peaking. Is no Degree of Comparison"; for it doth not compare 'I'things together ; however it is accounted one, Because the other two are founded upon, and formed from it. The Comparative Degree 1s-formed of the Positive, by adding the Syllable (er), if it ends with a Consonant, or the Letter (7) only, it the Positive ends in (Â¢); as for, Jester wife, wife: And it is likewise known by the Sign (more) before the Positive, as _former or more foot; avider or more wife. The Superlative Degree is formed of the Po- five, by adding the Syllable (e/), if it ends with a Consonant, or the Letters (4), it the Positive ends with an (Â¢);" as brightest, AVI/EFI. this likewise known by the  Signs.meal, very, OF exceeding, : There"",""2 4.

Note, That some Adverbs are also compared ; as, up upper, uppermost 5 above, over, overcool; -behind, bi very hindermost 5 beneath, nether, nethermost? 3 oft, others freely, BC. All Adjectives cannot be compared, be- cause their Signification does not admit of Increase; as all, every, one, any, each, some, BC. And it would not be good English to fay, more winery and off first; for we ought to fay, wife, Or more wife ; wifely, Or molt wife: For more Â«wife would signify as Minch as more wife; and MO AVIF?, as much as WF off AVIF,  Fair, fairer, feared, are the three Degrees of Coma- Ripon; fair is of the Positive Degree, because it signifies the Person to be.-simply for, without comparing him to any other Person.: For if I fay, Anne is fair, that does not gainsay but that Sarah may be as fair; fairer or more fair, ave of the Comparative Degree; because when | make a Comparison between Anne and Sarah, I find that Anne is fair, but that Sears is fairer or more  Jair; that is exceeding Anne in Beauty: Fair eff or mph fairy -are of the Superlative; because when I make a Comparison between Anne, Sarah, and Mary, I perceive that Anne is fair, but that Sarah is fairer or more fair, and that Mary is fairest or off fair of either Anne or Sarah; that is, Mary exceeds them both in the bighead Degree of Beauty.

Never be in Pain about Familiarity in the Stile to those with whom you are acquainted; for that very Pain will make it awkward and {tiff in Spite of all your Endeavors to the contrary,  Write freely, but not hastily; let your Words drop from your Pen, as they would from your Tongue when speaking deliberately on a Subject of which you are After, and to a Person with whom you are intimate.  Accustom yourself to think justly, and you will not be at a Loss to write clearly; for while there is Con- fusion at the Fountain Head, the Brook will never be clear.  Before you begin to write, think what you are going to write: However unnecessary this Caution may feet, I will venture to fay, that ten appear ridiculous on Paper through Hurry and Want of Thought,  for one that is for through Want of Understand- ING.

The fame Tradesman in London, by the next Post, received the following Letter from another young Shop-keeper in the Country, on his beginning Business for himself,  S I R, being obliged, by my late Mahlerâ€™s Decease, to enter immediately upon Business, and consequently open my Shop without going to Town to furnish myself with fuck Goods as at present I savant, I have sent you a fall Order, as underwritten.

I 2m your humble Servant, C. K.  This was writing like a Man that understood what he was doing, and such a Letter could not want its proper EffieÂ® upon such a Correspondent in London.  In short, a Tradesmanâ€™s Letter should be plain and concise, and to the Purpose; no quaint Expressions, no Book Phrases, no Flourishes; and .yet they must be full and sufficient to express what he means, for as not to be doubtful, much left unintelligible, 1 can LY no Means approve of studied Abbreviations, and leaving out the needful Copulatives of Speech in trading Letters; they are (suggestion limit reached) to the (suggestion limit reached) (suggestion limit reached): For, in a Word, â€™tis (suggestion limit reached) to be thought a Man of more than ordinary (suggestion limit reached), by writing extraordinary (suggestion limit reached) ;"  affecting"",""36 9H INTRODUCTION.

It is usual among the Polite, to sign their Names at  A considerable Distance below the Conclusion of the Letter, and thereby leave a large vacant Space over their Names, which, thoâ€™ customary, I would by all means advice you to avoid "; because this putting it in the Power of anyone who has your Letter, to write what he pleases over your Name, and to make you in all Appearance have signed a writing that you would by no means have FET your Hand to.

This is not living, but a constant Endeavor to cheat themselves out of the little time they have to live; for they generally inherit a bad Constitution, make it wore by their absurd Way of Life, and deliver a still weaker and weaker thread down to their Children. I donâ€™t know any one Thing more ridiculous, than the feeing their wrinkled fallow Faces all FET off with Diamonds, Poor mistaken Gentlewomen! They should endeavor to avoid Peopleâ€™s Eyes as much as possible, and not to attract them ; for they are really a quite deplorable Sight, and their very Faces are a standing Teflon against the strange Lives they lead.  People in a lower Life, â€™tis true, do not act for riding- loudly as those in a higher, but even among them too thereâ€™s vast Difference between the People that live well, and the People that live ill : The former are more heal-thy, in better spirits, fitter for Business, and nore attentive to it; the latter are more negligent, more neck- {y, more contemptible, and more defeated.  In Truth, either in high or low Life, Virtue is only another Name for Happiness, and Debauchery is. the High-Road to Misery; and this, to IME, appears just as true and evident, as that Moderation is always good for us, and Excess always hurtful.  ... But is it not a charming Thing to have Youth and Beauty, â€”to be followâ€™d and admired, â€”to have Presents offerâ€™d from all sides to one, â€” to be invited to all Diver- fins, and to be distinguished by the Men from all the left of the Company?

But, full of the Ardor which the Truth inspires, I dare to advance the contrary, and to affect, boldly, that  Â© it is Marriage-Love only which can be delightful to a  Â© good mind.  *Â® We cannot taste the Sweets of perfectÂ® Love but in  """"A well-suited Marriage. Nothing for much distinguishes  """"A little Mind as to top at words. What signifies that Custom. (for which we feel very good Reasons) of make ING the Name of Husband and Wife ridiculous?

A well-regulated Marriage is not like those of Ambition and Interest: It is two Lovers who live together. Let a Priest pronounce  certain Words, let an Attorney {IGN certain Papers"; I look upon there Preparations as a Lover does on a Lad-  - der of Cords, that he fixes to the Window of his Mid- trefs,  I know there are some People of {all Delicacy, who ~ maintain that the Pleasures of Love are only due to ~ Difficulties and Dangers.

The Life of married Lovers is very  different, they pass it in a Chain of mutual Obligations  â€˜and Marks of Benevolence, and have the Pleasure of  â€˜forming the entire Happiness of the Object beloved; in  Which Point I place perfect Enjoyment.  ~The most trifling Cares of (Economy become no-  â€˜Lee and delicate, when they are heightened by Sent-  Meets of Tenderness.

LETTER VEIL To Lucinda, on the Happing/s of a domestic Matrimonial Life. |) July 5, 1764. AA R for many Years which we have paled, my Lucinda, almost without Separation, one would naturally imagine that the few Days Absence I have known should not: be displeasing, and yet believe me, I am already tired of the Town, and am I preparing to leave 1t with the utmost Expedition to return to do- mephitic Joys.  When I rifleÂ® on my Disposition, T am greatly thankful to Providence that the fame Dislike for public Pleasures- has always.

Though I own myself in general but little fond of the Town, yet I never fail of feeing Objects in it which remind me of my own Felicity, and increase the Love I bear you. Alas! My Dear, the fashionable Tenor of matrimonial. Lives is for little footed to my Turn of Mind, that I must have been wretched with what is now called a very good Wife.

Q 3 IZ"",""150 The Complete LETTER-WRITER.  It is however, happy for Mankind, that the fame Delicacy does not universally prevail, as there are now many Couples who are thought to be happy, because the Wife has never transgressed the Bounds of Virtue, nor the Husband treated her with Language which he â€œwould be ashamed to UFE to a Stranger. Their Amuse- meets are distinct from each other, they know nothing of that heart-felt Joy which arises from being with those they love, secluded from every Eye, and breathing the Sweets of the balmy evening. Their only Care 1s refining those Pleasures which Repetition has rendered dull, and inventing new Arts to pass the tedious Day, which, notwithstanding their Endeavors, afford some Hours in which that most impertinent of all Companions, called S://, never fails of Intrusion,  There are many Women in the World, I believe, to whom I might have made 'a good Husband, but] do not recalledÂ¢t any one but my Lucinda who could have made me a happy one.

At Length, my Cleanthes, that Friendship which we once divided is now confined to ourselves. We have been those who advanced with us along the Vale of Life, fink into the Grave, and have lived to be the only Links of the Chain of Friendship which we helped to constitute at our Entrance on the World, We have together, in the Hours of Youth, looked back and defined the Toys of Infancy, in our Manhood we have failed at the Pleasures of our Youth, and are now come -to that Age in which we look back on all alike, and con-  . Wider every Prospect that terminate son this Side the Grave as beneath our Notice or Regard.  At this Season of Life, one of the most considerable Pleasures which remains to human Nature, is the Recollection of the Moments which are part. Now, whilst I. write, my Cleanthes, I recall with Satisfaction the Time in which we were induced, by a Parity of Sentiments, to form the social Connection, and the steady Union in which we have puffed from that Hour to the present, The Time approaches which must put a Period to our Friendship, none hope -that Providence will extend their Lives to an unusual Length but those who fear to die"; as for ourselves, we have reached that age which few are born to attain, and which, in the Language of an admired Writer, requires a great deal of Providence to produce. I flatter myself that our Days have been for {pent that we have no Reason to tremble at the Thought of our last, nor embitter the remaining Part of our Life with Apprehension for the inevitable Hour to come.  We have lent the Tear of Pity to Distress, and all. deviated the Misfortunes of our Fellow Creatures, we have neither indulged our Passions nor neglected the Praise we owe the Author of our Mercies. Why, therefore, should we tremble? We leave a World whole Pleasures we are no longer capable of profiling, we have puffed through its Enjoyments, and have found them vain, we leave it for the happiest of States: And vet the tender Tie of Parents holds us;" we must leave those whom Nature obliges us to love: Yet let us re- Co member"",""The Complete Alerter-WRITER. 153 members that we leave them to the Care of a divine Providence, and be thankful that we were not called whilst their Minds were yet unformed, or we had conducted them from the Budding to the Bloom of Reason.

Cleanthes, therefore, who enjoys the Bluffing of Health in a more eminent Degree than his Friend, will heighten to fee and give him the greatest Satisfaction he can possibly know.  I write this from the Grotto which Lucindaâ€™s Fancy decorated, and where we have paled for many happy Hours. Providence has taken Care to wean us from the Love of Life by Degrees. Scarce have we reached the ripened Age of Manhood: before we have more Friends in the Grave than surviving, and from that Moment, which -is almost the first of serious Reflection, we begin to perceive the Vanity of human Happiness.

But your Father, who loves you sincerely, and who confiders you as part of himself, can never feel you do any Thing that may tend to your Disadvantage, without warning you of the Consequence ; for that Father must have a very bad Heart, or a very bad Head indeed, who does not inform his Son of his Faults, Yours is not an Error of Disposition, but of Judgment, and therefore it may be easily rectified. You 1 know, my dear Tom, intend it for Civility and Politeness; but you are mistaken. Forced and affected Compliments are the Reverse, Politeness is ever attained - with EAFE and Freedom, and defines every Thing that is unnatural, Besides, this Cringing and Fawning render your Sincerity unpetted. Those who make large Professions to every-body, are esteemed by no-body. It is all considered as Froth, and their Friendship is supposed to be as trifling, infixed, and troublesome, as their Conversation. Cast off, therefore, my dear Tom, this Sort of Behavior, and put on one that 1s more manly, and consistent with the Character of your Family, who were always esteemed for their Openness, Freedom and Sincerity, which entitles a Man to more Respect, than all the fine Speeches and low Bows in the World. Not that I would have you entirely DIF- regard what you brought from the Dancing-School : A proper Deportment is necessary, and even a little Ceremony may be consistent with Politeness and Good-Manners 3 â€™tis the Excess that makes it blamable.

This he does with wonderful Dexterity, and offers every one an Occasion of DIF- playing his Talents; for he knows, that in order to keep up a universal good Humor, every Man f(would be pleased with himself as well as with his Company. And pray what pleases a Man more, than to have an Opportunity of letting the Circle know that he is some- body ? How unlike him are those, who having.{fern nothing of the World, expose themselves to Contempt and Ridicule, by impertinently giving their Opinion of Things they do not understand ? What Mr. Montagu fays is always to the Purpose, is properly addressed, and every Body hears him with Satisfaction; for though he is young in years, he is old in Experience and Under{teind- ING. When, he speaks it is always with a becoming EAFE and Freedom. He has Resolution enough to defend and support the Truth ; but always delivers his Sentiments in such a Manner, that it may not appear like dictating to the Company; and when he has done, he hears (let them differ from him ever for much) with Patience, Complacency, and Temper. In short, Tom, Excels of Ceremony will never gain Man Friends, but impertinent Babbling will undoubtedly create in Enemies ; for Conversation is a Banquet, which every Man is entitled to a Share of, who is present; and why should anyone expect to have the whole Feast to himself ?
